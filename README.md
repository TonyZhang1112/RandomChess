# RandomChess

A Personal Project created by Tony Zhang

Face off against three different levels of bots in a game of chess where the backrank configuation is random (but symettrical)

## Difficulties:
**Easy**: A Greedy Bot, will always play the move that looks the best without even considering what the opponent may do. Will always detect a Mate in One.

**Medium**: Slightly better than Easy, the medium bot will look at what the opponent may do, but not much further. Will always detect a Mate in Two.

**Hard**: Looks further ahead. Will always detect a Mate in Three.
